# Background Blurring Web App

This repository contains three separate web applications that demonstrate real-time background blurring using different computer vision technologies: **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow Lite**. Each folder contains the respective implementation along with necessary scripts and instructions to run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before running any of the web applications, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8 or above**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)
- **OpenCV** (required for the OpenCV implementation)
- **MediaPipe** (required for the MediaPipe implementation)
- **TensorFlow Lite** (required for the TensorFlow Lite implementation)

Each implementation folder contains a `requirements.txt` file. You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Applications

### 1. MediaPipe Implementation

The MediaPipe implementation leverages the MediaPipe library to perform real-time background blurring using the selfie segmentation model.

**Steps to run:**

1. **Navigate to the `mediapipe-webapp` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mediapipe-webapp
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Access the web app:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 2. OpenCV Implementation

The OpenCV implementation uses traditional computer vision techniques to blur the background in real-time.

**Steps to run:**

1. **Navigate to the `opencv-webapp` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd opencv-webapp
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Access the web app:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 3. TensorFlow Lite Implementation

The TensorFlow Lite implementation uses the DeepLabV3 model for semantic segmentation and real-time background blurring.

**Steps to run:**

1. **Navigate to the `tensorflowlite-webapp` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tensorflowlite-webapp
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download and place the `deeplabv3.tflite` model in the directory:**
    Ensure the model is named `deeplabv3.tflite` or update the `app.py` accordingly.

4. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Access the web app:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Notes

- **Compatibility:** Ensure that your system has a working webcam and that you have the necessary permissions to access it from your browser. The applications have been tested primarily on Windows and macOS.

- **Performance:** The performance of each implementation (MediaPipe, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) can vary significantly depending on your systemâ€™s hardware, particularly the CPU and GPU. The applications include real-time performance metrics to help you analyze the efficiency of each method.

- **Customization:** You can customize the blur types and FPS settings via the dropdown menus in the web application. The changes will be applied in real-time as you interact with the interface.

- **TensorFlow Lite Model:** For the TensorFlow Lite implementation, you must download the `deeplabv3.tflite` model and place it in the corresponding directory. Make sure the model file name in the code matches the actual file name.

- **Potential Issues:** If you experience any issues with performance stats not displaying correctly, ensure that you have the latest version of the required libraries installed and that your system meets the necessary hardware requirements.

- **Further Development:** The applications are designed for demonstration and testing purposes. For production-level deployment, consider optimizing the code further and possibly integrating with more robust frameworks or cloud services.
